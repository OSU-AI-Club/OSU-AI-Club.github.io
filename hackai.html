            <h2><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Why sponsor?</h2>

            <p>
              Sponsors are what make Hack AI possible. Without them, Hack AI
              would not exist. The food, friendly environment, and opportunities
              available are all due to organizations chipping in.
            </p>

            <p>
              To help, sponsors get many unique benefits. For the full
              sponsorship packet, email the OSU AI Club.
