                        <p>
                            Sponsors are what make Hack AI possible. Without them, Hack AI would not exist. The food, friendly environment, and opportunities available are all due to organizations chipping in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To help, sponsors get many unique benefits. For the full sponsorship packet, email the OSU AI Club.
