                    Artificial Intelligence Club is excited to team up with Big Data Analytics Association to host Ohio State’s first Hack.AI hackathon. This will be a full day event, starting at 10AM and ending at 10PM. Participation in this event is a great way to gain practical hands-on experience in creating algorithms to solve real world problems, while networking with your peers, professors, and local companies. Food and drinks will be provided throughout the duration of the event. The event will have limited capacity, therefore preference will be given to students who have attended previous AI Club meetings.

                    When: March 31st
                    Where: 18th Ave. Library, Rooms 070 & 090

                    <ul>
                    <li><em>Q: An AI Hackathon? What does that mean? What will we be ‘hacking’?</em>
                    A: This event is similar to Hack OHIO in the way that you will be able to use whatever data/resources you legally obtain. You will apply machine learning models and artificial intelligence techniques to your data to create something awesome. There may be a sponsor challenge at the event that you can also compete in (using their provided dataset).
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Q: Define ‘something awesome’, dude. What will we be presenting/submitting by the end of the competition?</em>
                    A: Whether you want to teach your computer how to play flappy bird or recognize your darling cat, create a model that will predict how many Tom W. Davis Clocktower memes will be posted to reddit, or make a chatbot, the world is your oyster. As long as you are using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques! You will have to present your final creation, so we suggest preparing a professional presentation along with your creation.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Q: What if I have no experience in making machine learning models or creating artificial intelligence?</em>
                    A: There are excellent, free online tutorials on how to get started with a machine learning model/creating artificial intelligence. Links are provided in the ‘Resources’ section. There will also be mentors at the hackathon, dedicated to getting your idea off the ground. 
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q: Where can I find datasets to train my models?</em>
                    A: Links to sources of data are provided below, in the ‘Resources’ section.
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q. What if I want to do something hardware based?</em>
                    A: Hardware based projects are welcome, but unfortunately we will not be providing any hardware supplies. 
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q: Will food be provided at this event?</em>
                    A: Yes, food will be provided, free of charge - lunch and dinner will be served.
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q: What if I’m a vegetarian?</em>
                    A: Food options for vegetarians will be provided!
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q: When should I be at the hackathon?</em>
                    A: Check-in starts at 8:00 am and hacking begins at 10:00 am. Please arrive before 10:00 am!
                </li>
                    <li><em>Q: What should I bring to the hackathon?</em>
                    A: You should bring your laptop/desktop, chargers, comfortable clothes, and the excitement to make something awesome.
