The website for the OSU AI CLUB. URL: OSU-AI-Club.github.io

# Design Decisions
Keep this as static as possible. There is little to no need for generated content, js frameworks (react, vue, ember), php, etc etc.

Also, please keep the site as simple as possible. Club officers comme from a variety of backgrounds and might not be familiar with web development and git.

# Maintenance
To invalidate any caching, go into Settings and toggle off/on the "Enforce HTTPS" option.
